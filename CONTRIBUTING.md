# Contributing

This repository is a local workbench for CAD-related agent skills. Treat
`skills/` as the product under test and `models/` as the shared
fixture/artifact area.

## Local Checkout

For development, branch from `develop` and open PRs back to `develop`:

```bash
git clone --branch develop https://github.com/earthtojake/text-to-cad.git
cd text-to-cad
git switch -c my-change
```

Create the repo-local Python development environment:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
./.venv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip
./.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

`requirements-dev.txt` installs the source packages from `packages/` and the
small set of Python extras mirrored from skill runtime requirements. This is
the default Python environment for broad repo checks and source-checkout
development. Skill-specific environments may install generated, skill-local
package copies so they match production, but on `develop` you should still edit the
source package under `packages/*`.

For CAD Viewer development:

```bash
npm --prefix viewer install
```

When running a tool manually, use that skill's interpreter:

```bash
.venv/skills/cad/bin/python skills/cad/scripts/step --help
.venv/skills/urdf/bin/python skills/urdf/scripts/urdf --help
```

## Link Skills Into Your Agent

For local development, symlink this checkout's supported skill directories into
your agent. Do not copy skill directories into your agent: symlinks keep edits
in this checkout visible immediately.

Use the installer from the repository root:

```bash
scripts/install/install-skills.sh --agent codex
```

To see supported agents and resolved destination directories:

```bash
scripts/install/install-skills.sh --list-agents
```

The installer discovers each directory under `skills/` that contains
`SKILL.md`, creates one symlink per skill, and leaves existing non-symlink paths
untouched.

Supported local-development agent destinations:

| Agent flag  | Destination                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `codex`     | `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills`              |
| `claude`    | `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}/skills`      |
| `gemini`    | `$HOME/.gemini/skills`                            |
| `universal` | `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/agents/skills` |
| `project`   | `.agents/skills` in this repository               |

`claude-code`, `gemini-cli`, `agents`, and `repo` are accepted aliases. Use
`--all` to install into every destination above, or repeat `--agent` for a
smaller set:

```bash
scripts/install/install-skills.sh --agent codex --agent claude
```

Restart or reload the agent after linking so it rescans available skills.

To remove this checkout's skill links while testing provider behavior:

```bash
scripts/install/uninstall-skills.sh --agent codex
```

The uninstaller removes only symlinks that point back at this checkout and
prunes empty destination directories unless `--keep-empty-dirs` is passed.

## Test From This Repository

Run development and test prompts from inside this repository instead of a
separate project checkout. The skills assume this workbench layout while you are
iterating: `models/` contains fixtures and generated CAD artifacts, `viewer/`
contains the editable CAD Viewer source, and repo-relative validation commands
live under `scripts/`.

Write test, sample, and durable CAD/robot-description artifacts under `models/`;
do not create ad hoc artifact directories elsewhere. When you need a scratch
project, create it under this checkout, for example:

```bash
mkdir -p models/experiments/my-test
```

Then start your agent with `/path/to/text-to-cad` as the working directory and
ask it to write files under that scratch path. This keeps skill scripts,
fixtures, generated sidecars, and Viewer links using the same repo-relative
paths that CI and local checks expect.

## Source Boundaries

Each skill must be self-contained and independent when it is installed from a
production branch: it must not import or depend on code from another skill or
from repository-root modules at runtime.

The `develop` branch uses symlinks as a checkout layout convenience. Those symlinks
point generated-output paths back to the canonical sources so contributors can
edit one copy of shared code. They do not relax the runtime self-containment
rule: production branches must be able to replace the symlinks with real copies
that still run without `skills/`, the repository root, or sibling skill
directories on `sys.path`, `PYTHONPATH`, `NODE_PATH`, or similar lookup paths.

Canonical source directories are:

- `skills/*` for skill instructions, references, and skill-owned scripts.
- `viewer/` for CAD Viewer app and server source.
- `packages/*` for shared runtime helpers that are copied into consuming skills
  for production.

On `develop`, paths such as `skills/cad-viewer/scripts/viewer`,
`skills/*/scripts/packages/*`, `viewer/packages/*`, and `plugins/cad/skills/*`
should be symlinks when they mirror root sources. Treat those paths as
generated-output aliases, not separate source roots. Edit the canonical source
path instead.

Production-output checks are intentionally centralized. Normal development
should stay in the symlinked `develop` layout. When you specifically need to inspect
production outputs locally, use a temporary checkout or rerun
`scripts/dev/setup-symlinks.sh` afterward, then run:

```bash
scripts/bundle/bundle.sh --clean
scripts/bundle/bundle.sh --check
```

Do not run lower-level bundle scripts as part of routine iteration; use the
script-specific details in `scripts/README.md` only when you are debugging a
production-output check.

## Branch Layouts

Open development PRs against `develop`, not `main`. The `develop` branch keeps
generated copy targets as symlinks so the editable source remains under
`skills/`, `viewer/`, and `packages/`:

```bash
scripts/dev/setup-symlinks.sh
scripts/dev/setup-symlinks.sh --check
```

The `main` production branch must be installable from a plain checkout, so it
contains generated production outputs instead of symlinks. `main` is
publish-only: do not open PRs to `main` or push it directly. The `Test`
workflow runs on `develop` and PRs to `develop`: it starts from the symlink
layout, runs `scripts/bundle/bundle.sh --clean`, checks the production layout
without rebuilding it, runs documentation checks, and runs the code tests
against that generated output.

## Releases

Normal development PRs should not bump `plugins/cad/VERSION`; release versions
are reserved for release PRs so the canonical repo version, Git tag, and GitHub
Release describe the same production commit. PRs that do touch release state
must keep `plugins/cad/VERSION` and derived version metadata valid; the `Test`
workflow checks that metadata in a separate job so code tests still run when it
is wrong.

### Shipping a release

Run the `Release` GitHub Actions workflow. Its defaults are the real-release
settings — build from `develop` (`base_branch=develop`), publish to `main`
(`target_branch=main`), and publish the GitHub Release (`publish=true`, not a
draft) — and the input descriptions in `.github/workflows/release.yml` are
authoritative. Choose the semver bump (`patch`, `minor`, or `major`) or an
exact `set_version` deliberately for every release; if a release request does
not specify one, confirm it rather than assuming:

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml --ref develop -f bump=patch
```

One run bumps `plugins/cad/VERSION` plus derived metadata on a
`release/<version>` branch, opens a release PR, merges it into `develop`
immediately, and then runs the publish, models-upload, web-app deploy, and
tag/GitHub Release jobs in the same run. The release PR does not wait for its own CI checks; the
publish job repeats the full bundle and test validation against exactly what
ships. The publish job ships to `main` only when the
source version is newer than `main` and the latest semver tag, and refuses
sources that do not contain the previous publish source commit. It writes a
generated production merge commit on top of the previous publish target with
the release source as the second parent, which keeps `main` fast-forwardable
while preserving source commits for release notes and contributor attribution.
The GitHub Release is published immediately by default; set `publish=false` to
review it as a draft first. Treat generated outputs as CI products, not edit
targets.

### Testing CI/CD and build changes

Use `target_branch=build-test` only when explicitly testing changes to the
CI/CD pipeline or production build outputs; it is never part of a normal
release and should never be chosen by default. It rehearses the full publish
flow without touching `main`, deploying, or creating a tag/release. Use
`dry_run=true` to preview the version changes only, and `auto_merge=false` to
stop after preparing the release PR.

### Resuming a failed publish

If a run fails partway — including after `main` has moved but before the semver
tag exists — rerun `Release` with `set_version` pinned to the current version.
When `develop` already contains that version, the workflow skips the release PR
and proceeds straight to the publish jobs.

### Redeploying the web apps

The standalone `Deploy Docs` and `Deploy Viewer` workflows redeploy the
individual web apps to Vercel production without running a release. They
default to deploying `main` and expect a production-layout ref:

```bash
gh workflow run deploy-docs.yml -f ref=main
gh workflow run deploy-viewer.yml -f ref=main
```

### Uploading new models

The standalone `Upload Models` workflow uploads the `models/` catalog and CAD
Viewer assets to Vercel Blob without running a release or redeploying the
viewer. It skips assets that already match the remote catalog and fetches only
the missing Git LFS objects. Upload from a source ref — `main` does not
contain `models/`:

```bash
gh workflow run upload-models.yml -f ref=develop
```

### Local and manual fallbacks

For local release preparation, use the same scripts the workflow calls:

```bash
git fetch origin develop
git fetch --tags origin
scripts/release/bump-version.sh patch --no-commit
node scripts/release/sync-version.mjs
scripts/release/check-version.sh --incremented-from origin/main
node scripts/release/sync-version.mjs --check
```

`scripts/release/publish-github-release.sh` is the manual fallback for the tag
and GitHub Release step. Unlike the `Release` workflow, the script creates a
draft release unless `--publish` is passed.

### Repository settings

Configure GitHub branch settings/rulesets so `main` rejects PRs and direct
pushes, leaving the `Release` workflow's publish job as the only writer. Enable
repository tag rulesets for `[0-9]*.[0-9]*.[0-9]*` before publishing from
`main`, and enable immutable releases once the production flow is trusted.

Production users should continue cloning `main`; developers should treat
`develop` plus the `Release` workflow as the only route to `main`.

## Iteration Loop

1. Edit the relevant skill under `skills/<skill-name>/`.
2. Keep skill instructions narrow and executable: say when the skill applies,
   what inputs it expects, what it produces, and how to validate the work.
3. Prefer small files in `references/` and reusable scripts in `scripts/` over
   long inline instructions.
4. Add or update focused fixtures, tests, or benchmark cases when skill behavior
   changes so regressions are measurable.
5. Validate with the smallest relevant check before broad repo checks.

Generated artifacts should not become skill logic unless they are intentional
fixtures. Prefer source files plus deterministic regeneration.

## Common Dev Checks

Use path-targeted validation. Common checks from the repo root:

```bash
scripts/test/test.sh
scripts/dev/setup-symlinks.sh --check
scripts/release/check-version.sh
npm --prefix viewer run test
npm --prefix docs run check
```

Use `AGENTS.md` or `scripts/README.md` for path-specific validation when you are
working in a particular package, skill, plugin, docs site, or production-output
path.

For targeted Python skill-script tests, run the relevant unittest files with the
repo-local Python runtime, for example:

```bash
./.venv/bin/python -m unittest tests/python/skills/urdf/test_cli.py
```

Python tests live under `tests/python/`, grouped by tested surface:
`skills/<skill>`, `packages/<package>`, `viewer/<service>`, and `global`.

For fast CAD Viewer source iteration, run the root viewer app in dev mode. Do
not run the generated viewer from the cad-viewer skill while modifying Viewer
behavior:

```bash
npm --prefix viewer run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1
```

Use the printed URL with an absolute `?dir=/path/to/root` and any absolute
`?file=/path/to/model.step`. Do not assume a fixed dev port unless you pass
Vite's standard `--port` flag. Packaged Viewer runtime checks are
production-output checks; use `scripts/README.md` when you specifically need
that path.

## Git Hygiene

Do not commit local environments, dependency folders, caches, or temp files such
as `.venv/`, `node_modules/`, `.vite/`, `dist/`, `tmp/`, or local credentials.
Generated runtime changes should come from the production-output workflow, not
manual edits inside generated runtime folders.

CAD exchange files, generated render/topology assets, `assets/**`, and
`benchmarks/**` may be LFS-tracked. Never disable LFS filters for `git add`,
commits, or other object-writing operations.
