# Shared Packages

Reusable code that must be available to more than one skill lives here as a
normal Python package. Skills should import the package they bundle, not sibling
skill source directories.

Small shared runtime helpers such as `cadpy_metadata` should still use this
pattern: source lives once under `packages/`, then each consuming skill gets its
own generated `scripts/packages/<package>` copy.

For local development, install packages editable into the repo venv. For
production packaging, build wheels or install into a skill-local Python target
such as `vendor/python`.
